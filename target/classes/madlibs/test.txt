Stevens Institute of Technology is named for the distinguished family known as "America's First Family of Inventors." 
The Stevens family changed the face of American engineering forever, designing steamboats, locomotives, railroad tracks 
and a host of other technical innovations that powered a new nation. When inventor Edwin A. Stevens died in 1868, his 
will provided for the establishment of the university that now bears his family’s name. Two years later, in 1870, 
Stevens Institute of Technology opened, offering a rigorous engineering curriculum leading to the degree of 
Mechanical Engineer following a course of study firmly grounded both in scientific principles and the humanities.
Over subsequent decades, Stevens grew by leaps and bounds, evolving from a relatively small four-year undergraduate 
college of engineering into a leading global technical institution with particular strengths in key fields such as 
defense, maritime engineering, management and finance. The university produced two Nobel Prize winners and countless 
new technologies, including a new process for producing synthetic penicillin. In 1971, Stevens opened its doors to 
women for the first time. In 1982, Stevens became the first major U.S. educational institution to require students 
to purchase and use personal computers in the classroom. At approximately this same time, Stevens also developed one 
of the nation’s first intranets, foretelling a revolution in information technology.
Today Stevens continues to grow, expanding enrollment, facilities and research programs. The university's 
collaborations with industry and government include three National Centers of Excellence, designations from the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense and Office of Naval Research.
